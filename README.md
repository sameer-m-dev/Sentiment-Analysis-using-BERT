# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT

We will accomplish the final task by completing each task in the project:

* <b>Task 1</b>: An introduction to some basic theory behind BERT, and the problem we will be using it to solve
* <b>Task 2</b>: Explore dataset distribution and some basic preprocessing
* <b>Task 3</b>: Split dataset into training and validation using stratified approach
* <b>Task 4</b>: Loading pretrained tokenizer to encode our text data into numerical values (tensors)
* <b>Task 5</b>: Load in pretrained BERT with custom final layer
* <b>Task 6</b>: Create dataloaders to facilitate batch processing
* <b>Task 7</b>: Choose and optimizer and scheduler to control training of model
* <b>Task 8</b>: Design performance metrics for our problem
* <b>Task 9</b>: Create a training loop to control PyTorch finetuning of BERT using CPU or GPU acceleration
* <b>Task 10</b>: Load in a pre-saved finetuned BERT model and evaluate its performance, and some final thoughts
